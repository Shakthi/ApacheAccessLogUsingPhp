ApacheAccessLogUsingPhp
=======================

Quick and dirty php script that shows apache error log


 This scripts displays formated apache2 access/error logs for the local network only (iff remote adress 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.*.*) 
 
 
 However,try it in your own risk!! Accessing apache log files from php discouraged for security purpose.
